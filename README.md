# pymaceutical-challenge

This challenge adapt the new learn libary matplotlib into python. Using the editor jupyter notebook, we have to merge the 2 csv files about pharmaceutical testing for anit-cancer medications and obtain data about the drugs used in the experiment.  

I had Kelli Kennedy, a tutor of the bootcamp, to assist me in this assignement. 

I also used the websites, outside of the bootcamp, to help me on my journey. Listed below are the websites I used.
